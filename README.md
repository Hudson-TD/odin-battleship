The Odin Project: Battleship

# Description

This application is my recreation and interpretation of the classic game Battleship. It demonstrates my ability to work with factory functions, create artificial intelligence via a computer opponent, and keep track of state all with vanilla Javascript. This project was a real challenge and I gained a lot of valuable knowledge, most of which pertains to how Javascript works "under the hood". Nearing the end I could tell my process for logical thinking and understanding the language was leagues better than when I started "The Odin Project" (TOP).

# Goals

My goal with this project was not to rely on tutorials or peak at any similar projects completed by other "The Odin Project" students. I am happy to say that I met this goal and while painful in places, I believe the extra time, effort, and frustration has made me a better problem solver. I had a small amount of prior test driven development (TDD) practice and came to understand the beauty of thinking and testing logic before I began to craft the actual code. Having working tests was a rush and the red/green cycle was surprisingly fun.
